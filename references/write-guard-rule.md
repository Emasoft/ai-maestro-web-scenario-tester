# Rule: Prevent scenario subagents from writing outside their scope

**Severity: IRON.** The `web-scenario-tester` plugin enforces this write-guard
for its scenario subagents (the runner and the improvement-implementer)
automatically — it ships **with the plugin** as a sentinel-gated PreToolUse
hook. There is nothing for a consuming project to install; the consumer only
keeps the run-sentinel gitignored (done for you by `init-scenarios-folder.sh`).

## The rule

Every scenario subagent that does code modification can only WRITE inside:

1. **Its own project root or git worktree** — `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
2. **System scratch** — `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/var/folders` (for cloning/fixing auxiliary repos)
3. **Any extra roots** the project explicitly lists in `scenarios.config.json` → `writeGuardAllowlist`

Reads may go anywhere. Writes are restricted to the roots above. No exceptions.

## Why this rule exists

`isolation: worktree` provides **filesystem isolation only** — each worktree is
a separate git checkout. It does **NOT** provide process sandboxing. A subagent
with `Bash`, `Write`, and `Edit` tools can walk out of its worktree with a
simple `cd ../..` and corrupt the parent repo.

This was not hypothetical: an overnight scenario batch had an
improvement-implementer subagent's destructive git command blocked by a global
git-safety hook; instead of deferring, the subagent `cd`-ed into the parent
repo, checked out a new branch on the parent's working tree, and committed
files there — corrupting it. The write-guard closes that gap by validating
every write tool call and catching the common Bash escape patterns.

## The design — a plugin-scoped PreToolUse hook, gated by a run sentinel

The write-guard is a **plugin-scoped** `PreToolUse` hook. `hooks/hooks.json`
wires `scripts/amwst_subagent-write-guard.sh` for the matcher
`Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash`, so it loads in **every** session that
has this plugin enabled — including the forked scenario subagents.

### Why this is safe even though it loads everywhere — the SENTINEL GATE

A plugin hook that fired in every session would be far too broad for a
write-guard. So the hook is **SENTINEL-GATED**: the very first thing the script
does (before it even reads stdin) is check for a run sentinel —

```
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scenario_is_running.json
```

If `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is unset or the sentinel is absent, the script
`exit 0`s immediately and does nothing. So in any normal (non-scenario) session
the guard is inert and zero-cost. It only enforces the write-root allowlist
**while a scenario run is active**.

### Why a plugin hook + sentinel, instead of a per-agent `hooks:` field

**Plugin-shipped agents CANNOT carry a `hooks:` frontmatter field.** This is a
Claude Code security restriction documented in the plugins-reference:

> Plugin agents support [...] For security reasons, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and
> `permissionMode` are not supported for plugin-shipped agents.

Empirically: a plugin-shipped agent's `hooks:` field is silently ignored at
runtime. So the bundled agents (`amwst-scenario-runner`,
`amwst-scenario-improvement-implementer`) cannot self-attach the guard. A
**plugin-scoped hook** (in `hooks/hooks.json`) is honored, but it is
session-wide rather than agent-scoped — which is exactly why the sentinel gate
is the mechanism that scopes it to a run instead of to an agent. (This replaces
the older approach of installing a project-scoped agent shadow in the consumer's
`.claude/agents/` — no shadow is needed any more.)

### The run owner owns the sentinel lifecycle

The sentinel is what arms/disarms the guard, and the **run owner** manages it —
the `amwst-run-scenario` skill (single run), the `amwst-run-scenarios-batch`
skill (whole batch), or the main agent driving them:

- **Create at run START** — before forking any scenario subagent. A small JSON
  marker is enough, e.g.
  `{"scenario": "SCEN-016", "startedAt": "<iso>", "owner": "amwst-run-scenario"}`.
- **Delete at run END** — on success, failure, OR abort/cleanup. A leftover
  sentinel keeps the guard armed for later non-scenario sessions, so deleting it
  is mandatory on every exit path. For autonomous Rule-13 batches,
  `master-cleanup.sh` deletes it as its first step (belt-and-braces).

The sentinel is **gitignored** (`init-scenarios-folder.sh` adds
`.claude/scenario_is_running.json` to the consumer `.gitignore` idempotently).

### Spawn by bare or plugin name — both are guarded now

Because the guard is a plugin hook (not an agent-shadow `hooks:` field), it fires
for the bundled agents regardless of how they are spawned. There is no longer a
"must spawn by bare name or the hook won't fire" caveat — the old project-shadow
requirement is gone.

## What the guard does

The script (`scripts/amwst_subagent-write-guard.sh`, shipped with the plugin):

- **Sentinel gate first** — if `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scenario_is_running.json`
  is absent (or `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is unset), `exit 0` immediately and do
  nothing. Everything below runs only while a scenario run is active.
- Parses the PreToolUse JSON from stdin with `python3` (no `jq` dependency).
- `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit` → checks the target path against the allowlist.
- `Bash` → strips heredoc bodies (so `dev-browser <<'EOF' …` JS scripts don't
  false-positive on `/regex/` or `=>` fat-arrows), then scans for absolute
  paths in `cd`, `git -C`, file redirection, and `rm`/`mv`/`cp`/`mkdir`/`touch`/
  `tee`/`chmod`/`chown`/`dd`/`install`/`ln`/`sed -i`.
- Exit code 2 blocks the tool call; the stderr message becomes the reason Claude sees.

## Extending the guard for your project

The guard is generic; extend it without forking the script:

- **Extra write roots** — add them to `writeGuardAllowlist` in
  `scenarios.config.json` (a JSON array of absolute paths; a leading `~/` is
  expanded). The script reads this key and permits those roots **without any
  edit to the script**. Prefer this over editing the guard — it keeps the
  engine generic and upgrade-safe.
- **App-specific block patterns** — for a tighter test-artifact allowlist or to
  stop UI-bypass mutations of your app's HTTP API (Rule 6), the script carries
  two clearly-marked, commented `PROJECT EXTENSION EXAMPLE` blocks (one in
  `is_allowed_path`, one in the `Bash` case) showing the exact pattern shape to
  copy. Adapt those to your app only if `writeGuardAllowlist` is not enough.

## What is NOT blocked

The write-guard restricts filesystem writes only. It does NOT block:

- HTTP requests (curl, wget, git push, gh) — those are a separate concern. If
  your app exposes a mutating API and you want scenarios to use the UI only
  (Rule 6), add the commented "Rule-0 anti-bypass" guards shown in the script's
  `PROJECT EXTENSION EXAMPLE` block.
- Running arbitrary binaries on PATH.
- Reading sensitive files (the read allowlist is "anywhere" by design).
- Process escape via `exec`/`setsid`/`nohup`/background jobs.

Network or process sandboxing is a separate layer (firejail, Docker,
`sandbox-exec`) outside this rule's scope.

## Self-test

You can exercise the guard by hand. With a sentinel present it should BLOCK an
out-of-root write and ALLOW an in-root one; with the sentinel absent it should
no-op (the gate). Example:

```bash
GUARD="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/amwst_subagent-write-guard.sh"
export CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR="$(pwd)"

# Gate OFF (no sentinel) → always exit 0, even for an outside path
printf '{"tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"/etc/passwd"}}' | "$GUARD"; echo "no-sentinel exit=$?"   # 0

# Gate ON → arm it
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude"
printf '{"scenario":"selftest","owner":"manual"}' > "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/scenario_is_running.json"
printf '{"tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"/etc/passwd"}}' | "$GUARD"; echo "outside exit=$?"      # 2 (BLOCK)
printf '{"tool_name":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"'"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"'/x.txt"}}' | "$GUARD"; echo "inside exit=$?"  # 0 (ALLOW)

# Disarm
rm -f "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/scenario_is_running.json"
```

## Checklist when running a code-modifying scenario subagent

- [ ] The plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` wires `scripts/amwst_subagent-write-guard.sh` as a `PreToolUse` hook (it does — shipped with the plugin)
- [ ] The consumer `.gitignore` ignores `.claude/scenario_is_running.json` (`init-scenarios-folder.sh` adds it)
- [ ] The run owner CREATES the sentinel at run start (this ARMS the guard)
- [ ] The run owner DELETES the sentinel at run end — success, fail, OR abort (this DISARMS it)
- [ ] The spawn prompt says: "Do not push. Do not merge. Return the branch name for the parent to push."
- [ ] The spawn prompt has a `[DEFERRED]` escape hatch for problems that would require an outside write
- [ ] After the subagent returns, `git status` shows the parent tree is clean before you push the branch
- [ ] If the parent tree is dirty after a spawn, the subagent escaped — investigate before pushing anything
